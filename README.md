## Requirements

- **Java 17+**
- **JavaFX 21+** (for macOS compatibility)
- **Maven 3.6+**

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jimcor101/MusicVisualizer.git
   cd MusicVisualizer
   ```

2. **Compile the project:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

   Or alternatively:
   ```bash
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Launch the application
2. Select an audio file (MP3, WAV, or M4A) when prompted
3. The visualizer will start with the default Spectrum Bars mode
4. Use controls to switch modes and adjust settings

### Controls

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **1-8** - Switch between visualization modes
- **Space** - Toggle play/pause
- **F11** - Toggle fullscreen mode
- **Ctrl+S** - Toggle settings panel
- **Escape** - Exit fullscreen or quit application

#### UI Controls
- **Play/Pause Button** - Control audio playback
- **Volume Slider** - Adjust audio volume (0-100%)
- **Seek Bar** - Navigate through the audio track
- **Mode Dropdown** - Select visualization mode
- **Settings Panel** - Adjust smoothing factor and particle count

### Visualization Modes

#### Spectrum Bars (Mode 1)
Classic frequency spectrum display with colored bars representing different frequency bands. Includes waveform overlay for enhanced visual appeal.

#### Particles (Mode 2)
Dynamic particle system that spawns particles based on audio intensity. Particles have physics-based movement and fade over time.

#### Circular (Mode 3)
Radial spectrum visualization arranged in a circular pattern. Creates mesmerizing circular waves synchronized to the music.

#### Waveform (Mode 4)
Displays scrolling waveform history with color-coded trails showing the evolution of the audio signal over time.

#### 3D Spectrum (Mode 5)
Enhanced spectrum bars with perspective depth effects, creating a three-dimensional appearance with vanishing point perspective.

#### Oscilloscope (Mode 6)
Classic circular oscilloscope visualization with trailing effects, mimicking traditional audio equipment displays.

#### Mandala (Mode 7)
Beautiful 8-fold symmetric patterns that create kaleidoscope effects. The patterns rotate and pulse in response to the music.

#### Star Field (Mode 8)
Bass-responsive star particles that pulse, move, and form constellation lines based on low-frequency audio content.

## Configuration

The application supports various customizable parameters through the settings panel:

- **Smoothing Factor** (0.1-0.95): Controls how much the spectrum data is smoothed between frames
- **Particle Count** (1-50): Number of particles spawned per frame in particle mode
- **Beat Sensitivity**: Automatically adjusts based on audio content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start:**
- Ensure Java 17+ is installed
- Verify JavaFX 21+ is available
- Check that audio file formats are supported

**No audio visualization:**
- Verify audio file is not corrupted
- Check system audio output
- Try different audio file formats

**Poor performance:**
- Reduce smoothing factor in settings
- Lower particle count for particle mode
- Close other resource-intensive applications
